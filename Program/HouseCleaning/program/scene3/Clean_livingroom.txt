Clean livingroom
Walk to the living room and look around the sofa and see the pillows. Find and grab a towel to eliminate any gathered dust. Grab each of the pillows and wipe down the pillow with that towel to clean the dust off the surfaces and shake them before putting them back on the sofa. After that, walk to the TV and wipe off the screen with that towel to clean the dust off the surfaces.
